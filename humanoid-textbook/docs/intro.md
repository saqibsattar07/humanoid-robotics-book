# Introduction to the Humanoid Robotics Book

Welcome! This book is an exploration of the core concepts required to build and operate modern humanoid robots. We will journey through four key modules:

1.  **The Robotic Nervous System**: Understanding the communication backbone with ROS 2.
2.  **The Digital Twin**: Creating and using simulations for testing and training.
3.  **The AI-Robot Brain**: Implementing perception and navigation with advanced tools.
4.  **Vision-Language-Action**: Bringing it all together in a capstone project where the robot can be controlled with natural language.

Let's begin!
