## Prompt

/sp.plan

## Response snapshot

Completed the planning phase for "Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)". The implementation plan was updated with the feature's technical context, research questions were resolved, and initial design documents (`data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`) were created.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The feature now has a clear technical plan and is ready for task breakdown.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/002-digital-twin-simulation/plan.md`
  - `specs/002-digital-twin-simulation/research.md`
  - `specs/002-digital-twin-simulation/data-model.md`
  - `specs/002-digital-twin-simulation/quickstart.md`
  - `GEMINI.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.tasks`
- 🧠 Reflection: The planning process successfully translated the feature specification into a concrete technical plan for the second module.
