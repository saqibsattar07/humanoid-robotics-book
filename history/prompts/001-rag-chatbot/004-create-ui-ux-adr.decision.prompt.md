  Architectural decision detected: UI/UX architecture for Docusaurus book with RAG chatbot — Document reasoning and tradeoffs?
response_text: |
  Created ADR-002 documenting the UI/UX architecture decisions for the Docusaurus book with RAG chatbot. The ADR covers:

  Decision: Implement unified UI/UX architecture with Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion for consistent design, homepage layout with module cards, floating chatbot widget, and accessibility compliance.

  Context: Need for cohesive learning platform where homepage, book pages, and chatbot feel like one consistent product with minimal cognitive load and academic tone.

  Consequences: Positive (unified experience, consistent design, accessibility) and negative (coordination complexity, performance optimization) outcomes documented.

  Alternatives: Considered separate UI systems, heavy animations, marketing visuals, minimal interface but rejected for various reasons.

  The ADR properly documents the UI/UX architectural decision with clear rationale, tradeoffs, and references to related specifications.
outcome: "Successfully created ADR documenting the UI/UX architecture decisions for the Docusaurus book with RAG chatbot, including design system, layout, and accessibility requirements."
evaluation: "The ADR follows proper format with status, date, context, decision, consequences, alternatives, and references. It captures the architectural significance of the UI/UX choices and their long-term implications for the project."
