  Created comprehensive implementation tasks for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Unified Docusaurus UI with Embedded RAG Chatbot. The tasks file includes:

  - Phase 1: Setup tasks for project initialization
  - Phase 2: Foundational tasks for design system and backend foundation
  - Phase 3-8: User story-specific tasks for all six user stories:
    - US1: Full Book Question Answering (P1)
    - US2: Selected Text Question Answering (P2)
    - US3: Model Switching Capability (P1)
    - US4: Citation and Metadata Management (P1)
    - US5: Homepage Navigation (P1)
    - US6: Integrated Chat Experience (P1)
  - Phase 9: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

  The tasks follow proper format with IDs, parallel execution indicators [P], user story labels [US1-US6], specific file paths, and clear dependencies. Each user story is organized to be independently implementable and testable.
outcome: "Successfully created comprehensive task list that aligns with the updated specification and implementation plan, enabling incremental delivery of all user stories."
evaluation: "The tasks file follows proper structure with clear phases, user story organization, and implementation strategy. All requirements from the specification are addressed with specific, actionable tasks."
