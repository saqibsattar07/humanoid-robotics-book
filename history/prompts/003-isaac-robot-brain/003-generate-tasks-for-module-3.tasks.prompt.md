## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

Generated an actionable, dependency-ordered `tasks.md` file for "Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)" based on the available design artifacts.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The feature now has a clear, step-by-step implementation plan for creating the content for the third module.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were part of this plan.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/003-isaac-robot-brain/tasks.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement` or begin working on the tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of breaking down a content module into discrete, actionable tasks is now well-established and efficient.
