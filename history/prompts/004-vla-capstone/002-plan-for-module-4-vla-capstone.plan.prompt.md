## Prompt

/sp.plan

## Response snapshot

Completed the planning phase for "Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)". The implementation plan was updated with the feature's technical context, research questions were resolved, and initial design documents (`data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`) were created.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The feature now has a clear technical plan and is ready for task breakdown.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/004-vla-capstone/plan.md`
  - `specs/004-vla-capstone/research.md`
  - `specs/004-vla-capstone/data-model.md`
  - `specs/004-vla-capstone/quickstart.md`
  - `GEMINI.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.tasks`
- 🧠 Reflection: The planning process for the final capstone module is complete, setting the stage for the implementation tasks that will bring all previous concepts together.
