## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

Generated an actionable, dependency-ordered `tasks.md` file for "Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)" based on the available design artifacts.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The feature now has a clear, step-by-step implementation plan for creating the content for the final capstone module.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were part of this plan.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/004-vla-capstone/tasks.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement` or begin working on the tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: This completes the specification, planning, and task breakdown for all four modules of the book. The project is now fully planned and ready for implementation.
